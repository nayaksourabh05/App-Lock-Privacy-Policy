  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how App Lock collects, uses, and protects your information. By using our app, you agree to the terms described in this policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. Our app functions entirely on your device and does not store or transmit your data to our servers.</p>
  <p>However, to ensure core functionality, the app may require the following permissions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessibility Service Permission:</strong> Used to detect and restrict access to selected apps for privacy protection. This data is not stored or shared externally.</li>
    <li><strong>Notification Access Permission:</strong> Required to manage notifications from apps to support specific lock and privacy-related features. No data is stored or transmitted externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    - <strong>App Lock Functionality:</strong> We use AccessibilityService to monitor foreground apps and lock access to selected apps as configured by the user.<br />
    - <strong>Notification Management:</strong> We use Notification Access to read notifications for privacy-focused features like hiding or managing sensitive content.
  </p>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use these permissions for any form of data collection, analytics, or advertising.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All user preferences and app lock configurations are stored locally on your device. We do not collect or transmit any user data. The app uses Android's built-in security features to protect your information.</p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the app and/or on the app’s Play Store listing. Your continued use of the app indicates your acceptance of these changes.</p>
